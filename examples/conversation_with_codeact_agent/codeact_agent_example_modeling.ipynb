    "CodeAct agent is an agent that not only chats but also writes and executes Python code for you.\n",
    "More details can be found in the project's related [github repo](https://github.com/xingyaoww/code-act). In the example here, we implement the CodeAct agent, and provide a simple example of how to use the CodeAct agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Follow [READMD.md](https://github.com/modelscope/agentscope) to install AgentScope. We require the lastest version, so you should build from source by running `pip install -e .` instead of intalling from pypi. \n",
    "- Prepare a model configuration. AgentScope supports both local deployed model services (CPU or GPU) and third-party services. More details and example model configurations please refer to our [tutorial](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/en/tutorial/203-model.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "- The example is tested with the following models. For other models, you may need to adjust the prompt.\n",
