AgentScope Studio
=========================

AgentScope Studio is a local-deployed web application that

- provides **project management** for the development of agent applications
- provides native **visualization** for running applications and tracing
- provides a **built-in agent** named "Friday" that supports secondary development

.. note:: The Studio is under fast development, more features are coming soon!

Quick Start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AgentScope Studio is installed via ``npm``:

.. code-block:: bash

    npm install -g agentscope-studio


Start the Studio with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    as_studio

To connect your application to the Studio, use the ``agentscope.init`` function with the ``studio_url`` parameter:

.. code-block:: python

    import agentscope

    agentscope.init(studio_url="http://localhost:8000")

    # your application code
    ...

Then, you can see your application in the Studio as follows:
