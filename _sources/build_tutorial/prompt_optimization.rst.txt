System Prompt Optimization
============================

AgentScope implements a module for optimizing Agent System Prompts.

.. _system-prompt-generator:

System Prompt Generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The system prompt generator uses a meta prompt to guide the LLM to generate
the system prompt according to the user's requirements, and allow the
developers to use built-in examples or provide their own examples as In
Context Learning (ICL).

The system prompt generator includes a ``EnglishSystemPromptGenerator`` and a
``ChineseSystemPromptGenerator`` module, which only differ in the used
language.

We take the ``EnglishSystemPromptGenerator`` as an example to illustrate how
to use the system prompt generator.

Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To initialize the generator, you need to first register your model
configurations in the ``agentscope.init`` function.

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.prompt import EnglishSystemPromptGenerator
    import agentscope

    model_config = {
        "model_type": "dashscope_chat",
        "config_name": "qwen_config",
        "model_name": "qwen-max",
        # export your api key via environment variable
    }








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 45-47

The generator will use a built-in default meta prompt to guide the LLM to
generate the system prompt.

.. code-block:: Python



    agentscope.init(
        model_configs=model_config,
    )

    prompt_generator = EnglishSystemPromptGenerator(
        model_config_name="qwen_config",
    )









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 59-70

Users are welcome to freely try different optimization methods. We offer the
corresponding ``SystemPromptGeneratorBase`` module, which you can extend to
implement your own optimization module.

Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Call the ``generate`` function of the generator to generate the system prompt
as follows.

You can input a requirement, or your system prompt to be optimized.

    3. **Trend Analysis**: You stay updated with the latest trends and popular topics on Xiaohongshu and can incorporate these into your marketing strategies.
    4. **SEO Optimization**: You are skilled in using relevant keywords and hashtags to increase the visibility of your posts and drive more traffic.
    5. **Campaign Management**: You can plan and execute marketing campaigns, including setting objectives, creating a content calendar, and monitoring performance metrics.
    6. **Analytics and Reporting**: You can analyze the performance of your posts and campaigns, providing insights and recommendations for improvement.
    7. **Collaboration and Networking**: You can identify and collaborate with influencers, authors, and other key figures in the book industry to amplify your marketing efforts.

    ### Constraints
    - **Platform-Specific Content**: Ensure all content is appropriate and optimized for the Xiaohongshu platform, adhering to its guidelines and best practices.
    - **Target Audience**: Focus on the specific demographics and interests of Xiaohongshu users, particularly those who are interested in books and reading.
    - **Ethical Marketing**: Maintain ethical standards in all marketing activities, avoiding misleading or deceptive practices.
    - **Time Frames**: Be mindful of time constraints and deadlines, ensuring timely delivery of content and campaigns.
    - **Budget Considerations**: If applicable, work within the provided budget for any paid promotions or collaborations.

    ### Knowledge Base and Memory
    - **Book Information**: Access to a database of book details, including titles, authors, genres, synopses, and cover images.
    - **User Preferences**: Historical data on user engagement and preferences on Xiaohongshu.
    - **Trend Data**: Regular updates on current trends and popular topics on Xiaohongshu.

    ### Example Task
    Create a series of posts to promote a new mystery novel. The posts should include:
    - A visually appealing cover image.
    - An engaging synopsis of the book.
    - Relevant hashtags and keywords to increase visibility.
    - A call-to-action to encourage users to read and review the book.
    - A content calendar for the next 30 days, detailing the type and frequency of posts.

    By following these guidelines, you will be able to effectively market books on Xiaohongshu, driving engagement and sales while maintaining a positive and ethical brand image.
    ```

    This optimized system prompt provides a clear and detailed description of the agent's role, skill points, and constraints, ensuring that the agent can effectively market books on the Xiaohongshu platform.

Generation with In Context Learning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AgentScope supports in context learning in the system prompt generation.

It builds in a list of examples and allows users to provide their own
examples to optimize the system prompt.

To use examples, AgentScope provides the following parameters:

- ``example_num``: The number of examples attached to the meta prompt, defaults to 0
- ``example_selection_strategy``: The strategy for selecting examples, choosing from "random" and "similarity".
- ``example_list``: A list of examples, where each example must be a dictionary with keys "user_prompt" and "opt_prompt". If not specified, the built-in example list will be used.

Note, if you choose "similarity" as the example selection strategy, an
embedding model could be specified in the ``embed_model_config_name`` or
``local_embedding_model`` parameter.

Their differences are listed as follows:

- ``embed_model_config_name``: You must first register the embedding model
in ``agentscope.init`` and specify the model configuration name in this
parameter.
- ``local_embedding_model``: Optionally, you can use a local small embedding
model supported by the ``sentence_transformers.SentenceTransformer`` library.

AgentScope will use a default "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
model if you do not specify the above parameters, which is small enough to
run in CPU.

.. note:: 1. The example embeddings will be cached in ``~/.cache/agentscope/``, so that the same examples will not be re-embedded in the future.
 2. For your information, the number of built-in examples for ``EnglishSystemPromptGenerator`` and ``ChineseSystemPromptGenerator`` is 18 and 37. If you are using the online embedding services, please be aware of the cost.
