MultiModality
============================

In this section, we will show how to build multimodal applications in AgentScope with two examples.

- The first example demonstrates how to use vision LLMs within an agent, and
- the second example shows how to use text to image generation within an agent.

Building Vision Agent
------------------------------

For most LLM APIs, the vision and non-vision LLMs share the same APIs, and only differ in the input format.
In AgentScope, the `format` function of the model wrapper is responsible for converting the input `Msg` objects into the required format for vision LLMs.

That is, we only need to specify the vision LLM without changing the agent's code.
Taking "qwen-vl-max" as an example, its model configuration is the same as the non-vision LLMs in DashScope Chat API.

Refer to section :ref:`model_api` for the vision LLM APIs supported in AgentScope.

As usual, we initialize AgentScope with the above configuration, and create a new agent with the vision LLM.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 34-46

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.agents import DialogAgent
    import agentscope

    agentscope.init(model_configs=model_config)

    agent = DialogAgent(
        name="Monday",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Monday.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-vl",
    )

To communicate with the vision agent with pictures, `Msg` class provides an `url` field.
You can put both local or online image URL(s) in the `url` field.

Let's first create an image with matplotlib

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 51-63

.. code-block:: Python


    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
    plt.bar(range(3), [2, 1, 4])
    plt.xticks(range(3), ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"])
    plt.title("The Apples Each Person Has in 2023")
    plt.xlabel("Number of Apples")

    plt.show()
    plt.savefig("./bar.png")

   :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 64-65

Then, we create a `Msg` object with the image URL

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 65-75

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.message import Msg

    msg = Msg(
        name="User",
        content="Describe the attached image for me.",
        role="user",
        url="./bar.png",
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 76-77

After that, we can send the message to the vision agent and get the response.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 77-79

.. code-block:: Python


    response = agent(msg)

    Monday: The image is a bar chart titled "The Apples Each Person Has in 2023." It shows the number of apples that three individuals, Alice, Bob, and Charlie, have. The y-axis represents the number of apples, ranging from 0 to 4, while the x-axis lists the names of the individuals.

    - Alice has 2 apples.
    - Bob has 1 apple.
    - Charlie has 4 apples.
