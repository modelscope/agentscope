Long-Term Memory
========================

In AgentScope, we provide a basic class for long-term memory (``LongTermMemoryBase``) and an implementation based on the `mem0 <https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0>`_ library (``Mem0LongTermMemory``).
Together with the design of ``ReActAgent`` class in :ref:`agent` section, we provide two long-term memory modes:

- ``agent_control``: the agent autonomously manages long-term memory by tool calls, and
- ``static_control``: the developer explicitly controls long-term memory operations.

Developers can also use the ``both`` mode, which activates both memory management modes.

.. hint:: These memory modes are suitable for different usage scenarios. Developers can choose the appropriate mode based on their needs.

Using mem0 Long-Term Memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: We provide an example of using mem0 long-term memory in the GitHub repository under the ``examples/long_term_memory/mem0`` directory.

The ``Mem0LongTermMemory`` class provides two main methods for long-term memory operations:
``record`` and ``retrieve``.
They take a list of messages as input and record/retrieve information from long-term memory.

As an example, we first store a user preference and then retrieve related information from long-term memory.

Integration with ReAct Agent
----------------------------------------
In AgentScope, the ``ReActAgent`` class receives a ``long_term_memory``
parameter in its constructor, as well as a ``long_term_memory_mode`` parameter
that specifies the long-term memory mode.

If ``long_term_memory_mode`` is set to ``agent_control`` or ``both``, two
tool functions ``record_to_memory`` and ``retrieve_from_memory`` will be
registered in the agent's toolkit, allowing the agent to autonomously
manage long-term memory through tool calls.

.. note:: To achieve the best results, the ``"agent_control"`` mode may require
 additional instructions in the system prompt.

Then we clear the short-term memory and ask the agent about the user's preferences.

Customizing Long-Term Memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AgentScope provides the ``LongTermMemoryBase`` base class, which defines the basic

Developers can inherit from ``LongTermMemoryBase`` to implement custom long-term
memory systems according to their needs：

.. list-table:: Long-term memory classes in AgentScope
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Class
      - Abstract Methods
      - Description

      - | ``record``
        | ``retrieve``
        | ``record_to_memory``
        | ``retrieve_from_memory``
      - - For ``"static_control"`` mode, you must implement the ``record`` and ``retrieve`` methods.
        - For ``"agent_control"`` mode, the ``record_to_memory`` and ``retrieve_from_memory`` methods must be implemented.
    * - ``Mem0LongTermMemory``

      - Long-term memory implementation based on the mem0 library, supporting vector storage and retrieval.
