Pipeline
========================

For multi-agent orchestration, AgentScope provides the ``agentscope.pipeline`` module
as syntax sugar for chaining agents together, including

- **MsgHub**: a message hub for broadcasting messages among multiple agents
- **sequential_pipeline** and **SequentialPipeline**: a functional and class-based implementation that chains agents in a sequential manner

Broadcasting with MsgHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``MsgHub`` class is an **async context manager**, receiving a list of agents as its participants.
When one participant generates a replying message, all other participants will receive this message by calling their ``observe`` method.

That means within a ``MsgHub`` context, developers don't need to manually send a replying message from one agent to another.
The broadcasting is automatically handled.

Here we create four agents: Alice, Bob, Charlie and David.
Then we start a meeting with Alice, Bob and Charlie by introducing themselves.
Note David is not included in this meeting.

    def create_agent(name: str, age: int, career: str) -> ReActAgent:
        """Create agent object by the given information."""
        return ReActAgent(
            name=name,
            sys_prompt=f"You're {name}, a {age}-year-old {career}",
            model=DashScopeChatModel(
                model_name="qwen-max",
                api_key=os.environ["DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"],
            ),
            formatter=DashScopeMultiAgentFormatter(),
        )


    alice = create_agent("Alice", 50, "teacher")
    bob = create_agent("Bob", 35, "engineer")
    charlie = create_agent("Charlie", 28, "designer")
    david = create_agent("David", 30, "developer")

Then we start a meeting and let them introduce themselves without manual message passing:

.. hint:: The message in ``announcement`` will be broadcasted to all participants when entering the ``MsgHub`` context.

        # Create a message hub

            participants=[alice, bob, charlie],
            announcement=Msg(
                "user",
                "Now introduce yourself in one sentence, including your name, age and career.",
                "user",
            ),
        ) as hub:
            # Group chat without manual message passing
            await alice()
            await bob()
            await charlie()

    Alice: Hello, my name is Alice, I'm 50 years old and I've been a dedicated teacher for many years.
    Bob: Hello, I'm Bob, a 35-year-old engineer with a passion for building and creating.
    Charlie: Hello, I'm Charlie, a 28-year-old designer with a flair for creating visually engaging and user-friendly designs.

Now let's check if Bob, Charlie and David received Alice's message.

.. code-block:: Python



    async def check_broadcast_message():
        """Check if the messages are broadcasted correctly."""
        user_msg = Msg(
            "user",
            "Do you know who's Alice, and what she does? Answer me briefly.",
            "user",
        )

        await bob(user_msg)
        await charlie(user_msg)
        await david(user_msg)


    asyncio.run(check_broadcast_message())





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Bob: Alice is a 50-year-old dedicated teacher.
    Charlie: Alice is a 50-year-old dedicated teacher.
    David: I don't have specific information about an Alice without more context. Could you provide more details, such as her last name or the field she works in?




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 105-184

Now we observe that Bob and Charlie know Alice and her profession, while David has no idea
about Alice since he is not included in the ``MsgHub`` context.


Dynamic Participant Management
---------------------------------------
Additionally, ``MsgHub`` supports to dynamically manage participants by the following methods:

- ``add``: add one or multiple agents as new participants
- ``delete``: remove one or multiple agents from participants, and they will no longer receive broadcasted messages
- ``broadcast``: broadcast a message to all current participants

.. note:: The newly added participants will not receive the previous messages.

.. code-block:: python

      async with MsgHub(participants=[alice]) as hub:
          # Add new participants
          hub.add(david)

          # Remove participants
          hub.delete(alice)

          # Broadcast to all current participants
          await hub.broadcast(
              Msg("system", "Now we begin to ...", "system"),
          )


Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pipeline serves as a syntax sugar for multi-agent orchestration.

Currently, AgentScope provides a sequential pipeline implementation, which
execute agents one by one in a predefined order.
For example, the two following code snippets are equivalent:


.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Code snippet 1: Manually call agents one by one

    msg = None
    msg = await alice(msg)
    msg = await bob(msg)
    msg = await charlie(msg)
    msg = await david(msg)


.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Code snippet 2: Use sequential pipeline

    from agentscope.pipeline import sequential_pipeline
    msg = await sequential_pipeline(
        # List of agents to be executed in order
        agents=[alice, bob, charlie, david],
        # The first input message, can be None
        msg=None
    )

.. tip:: By combining `MsgHub` and `sequential_pipeline`, you can create more complex workflows very easily.


Additionally, for reusability, we also provide a class-based implementation:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Using SequentialPipeline class

    from agentscope.pipeline import SequentialPipeline

    # Create a pipeline object
    pipeline = SequentialPipeline(agents=[alice, bob, charlie, david])

    # Call the pipeline
    msg = await pipeline(msg=None)

    # Reuse the pipeline with different input
    msg = await pipeline(msg=Msg("user", "Hello!", "user"))
