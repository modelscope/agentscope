Create ReAct Agent
====================

AgentScope provides out-of-the-box ReAct agent ``ReActAgent`` under ``agentscope.agent`` that can be used directly.

It supports the following features at the same time:

- ✨ Basic features
    - Support **hooks** around ``reply``, ``observe``, ``print``, ``_reasoning`` and ``_acting`` functions
    - Support structured output
- ✋ Realtime Steering
    - Support user **interrupt**
    - Support customized **interruption handling**
- 🛠️ Tools
    - Support both **sync/async** tool functions
    - Support **streaming** tool response
    - Support **stateful** tools management
    - Support **parallel** tool calls
    - Support **MCP** server
- 💾 Memory
    - Support **agent-controlled** long-term memory management
    - Support static long-term memory management

.. tip:: Refer to the :ref:`agent` section for more details about these
 features. In quickstart, we focus on how to create a ReAct agent and run it.

Creating ReAct Agent
------------------------------
To improve the flexibility, the ``ReActAgent`` class exposes the following parameters in its constructor:

.. list-table:: Initialization parameters of ``ReActAgent`` class
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Parameter
    - Further Reading
    - Description
  * - ``name`` (required)
    -
    - The name of the agent
  * - ``sys_prompt`` (required)
    -
    - The system prompt of the agent
  * - ``model`` (required)
    - :ref:`model`
    - The model used by the agent to generate responses
  * - ``formatter`` (required)
    - :ref:`prompt`
    - The prompt construction strategy, should be consisted with the model
  * - ``toolkit``
    - :ref:`tool`
    - The toolkit to register/call tool functions.
  * - ``memory``
    - :ref:`memory`
    - The short-term memory used to store the conversation history
  * - ``long_term_memory``
    - :ref:`long-term-memory`
    - The long-term memory
  * - ``long_term_memory_mode``
    - :ref:`long-term-memory`
    - The mode of the long-term memory:

      - ``agent_control``: allow agent to control the long-term memory by itself
      - ``static_control``: retrieving and recording from/to long-term memory will happen in the beginning/end of each reply.
      - ``both``: active the above two modes at the same time
  * - ``enable_meta_tool``
    - :ref:`tool`
    - Whether to enable the meta tool, which allows the agent to manage tools by itself
  * - ``parallel_tool_calls``
    - :ref:`agent`
    - Whether to allow parallel tool calls
  * - ``max_iters``
    -
    - The maximum number of iterations for the agent to generate a response

Taking DashScope API as example, we create an agent object as follows:

Creating From Scratch
--------------------------------
You may want to create an agent from scratch, AgentScope provides two base classes for you to inherit from:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Class
    - Abstract Methods
    - Description
  * - ``AgentBase``
    - | ``reply``
      | ``observe``
      | ``handle_interrupt``
    - - The base class for all agents, supporting pre- and post- hooks around ``reply``, ``observe`` and ``print`` functions.
      - Implement the realtime steering within the ``__call__`` method.
  * - ``ReActAgentBase``
    - | ``reply``
      | ``observe``
      | ``handle_interrupt``
      | ``_reasoning``
      | ``_acting``
    - Add two abstract functions ``_reasoning`` and ``_acting`` on the basis of ``AgentBase``, as well as their hooks.

Please refer to the :ref:`agent` section for more details about the agent class.

Taking the ``AgentBase`` class as an example, we can create a custom agent
class by inheriting from it and implementing the ``reply`` method.
