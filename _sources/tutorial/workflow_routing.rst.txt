Routing
==========================
There are two ways to implement routing in AgentScope, both simple and easy to implement:

- Routing by structured output
- Routing by tool calls

.. tip:: Considering there is no unified standard/definition for agent routing, we follow the setting in `Building effective agents <https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents>`_

Routing by Structured Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By this way, we can directly use the structured output of the agent to determine which agent to route the message to.

Initialize a routing agent

    Router: Of course, I can help with that. Could you please tell me more about what you'd like the poem to be about? For example, do you have a particular theme, mood, or style in mind?

Routing by Tool Calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another way is to wrap the downstream agents into a tool function, so that the routing agent decides which tool to call based on the user query.

We first define several tool functions:

    async def generate_python(demand: str) -> ToolResponse:
        """Generate Python code based on the demand.

        return ToolResponse(

After that, we define a routing agent and equip it with the above tool functions.

    PythonAgent: Here is a simple implementation of the quick sort algorithm in Python. This function sorts a list in-place using the Lomuto partition scheme.

    ```python
    def quick_sort(arr, low, high):
        if low < high:
            # Partition the array
            pi = partition(arr, low, high)
        
            # Recursively sort elements before and after partition
            quick_sort(arr, low, pi - 1)
            quick_sort(arr, pi + 1, high)


    def partition(arr, low, high):
        pivot = arr[high]  # Pivot
        i = low - 1  # Index of smaller element
        for j in range(low, high):
            # If current element is smaller than or equal to pivot
            if arr[j] <= pivot:
                i += 1  # Increment index of smaller element
                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]  # Swap elements
        arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]  # Swap the pivot element with the element at i+1
        return i + 1

    # Example usage:
    arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
    n = len(arr)
    quick_sort(arr, 0, n - 1)
    print('Sorted array:', arr)
    ```

    You can use this `quick_sort` function by passing the list you want to sort along with the starting and ending indices. The list will be sorted in place.
