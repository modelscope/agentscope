Conversation
======================

Conversation is a design pattern that agents exchange and share information
between each other, most commonly in game playing, chatbot, and multi-agent
discussion scenarios.

In AgentScope, the conversation is built upon the **explicit message
exchange**. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to build a conversation

- between a user and an agent (chatbot)
- between multiple agents (game playing, discussion, etc.)

Their main difference lies in

- how the **prompt is constructed**, and
- how the information is **propagated/shared** among agents.

User-Agent Conversation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
User-agent conversation, also known as chatbot, is the most common usage
scenario of LLM-empowered agents, and the design target of most LLM APIs.
Such conversation features only two participants: a user and an agent.

In AgentScope, the formatters with **"Chat"** in its name are designed for
user-agent conversation, such as ``DashScopeChatFormatter``,
``AnthropicChatFormatter``, etc.
They use the ``role`` field in the message to distinguish the user and the
agent, and format the messages accordingly.

Here we build a simple conversation between agent ``Friday`` and user.

.. tip:: AgentScope provides a built-in ``UserAgent`` class for human-in-the-loop (HITL) interaction. Refer to :ref:`user-agent` for more details.

    friday = ReActAgent(
        name="Friday",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Friday",
        model=DashScopeChatModel(
            model_name="qwen-max",
            api_key=os.environ["DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"],
        ),
        formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),  # The formatter for user-agent conversation

        toolkit=Toolkit(),
    )

    # Create a user agent
    user = UserAgent(name="User")

Now, we can program the conversation by exchanging messages between these two agents until the user types "exit" to end the conversation.

.. code-block:: python

    async def run_conversation() -> None:
        """Run a simple conversation between Friday and User."""
        msg = None
        while True:
            msg = await friday(msg)
            msg = await user(msg)
            if msg.get_text_content() == "exit":
                break

    asyncio.run(run_conversation())

More than Two Agents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As stated in the beginning, we demonstrate how to build conversation with multiple agents in terms of **prompt construction** and **information sharing**.

Prompt Construction
-------------------------------
In AgentScope, we provide built-in formatters for multi-agent conversation, featuring **"MultiAgent"** in their names, such as ``DashScopeMultiAgentFormatter``, ``AnthropicMultiAgentFormatter``, etc.

Specifically, they use the ``name`` field in the message to distinguish different agents, and format the conversation history into a single user message.
Taking ``DashScopeMultiAgentFormatter`` as an example:

.. tip:: More details about the formatter can be found in :ref:`prompt`.

    async def example_multi_agent_prompt() -> None:
        msgs = [
            Msg("system", "You're a helpful assistant named Bob.", "system"),
            Msg("Alice", "Hi!", "user"),
            Msg("Bob", "Hi! Nice to meet you guys.", "assistant"),
            Msg("Charlie", "Me too! I'm Charlie, by the way.", "assistant"),
        ]

        formatter = DashScopeMultiAgentFormatter()
        prompt = await formatter.format(msgs)

        print("Formatted prompt:")
        print(json.dumps(prompt, indent=4, ensure_ascii=False))

        # We print the content of the combined user message here for better
        # understanding:
        print("-------------")
        print("Combined message")
        print(prompt[1]["content"])

    Charlie: Me too! I'm Charlie, by the way.
    </history>

Message Sharing
-------------------------------
In multi-agent conversation, exchanging messages explicitly may not be efficient and convenient, especially when broadcasting messages among multiple agents.

Therefore, AgentScope provides an async context manager named ``MsgHub`` to simplify the operation of broadcasting messages.
Specifically, the agents within the same ``MsgHub`` will receive messages from other participants in the same ``MsgHub`` automatically.

    Bob: Hello Alice! I'm Bob, and just like you, I'm a student. I have a keen interest in technology and love to engage with all sorts of tech-related topics. It's a pleasure to meet someone who is as enthusiastic about learning as I am. What kind of things do you like to explore?
    Charlie: Alice: That's really cool, Bob! I'm actually quite interested in a wide range of topics, from literature and art to science. Recently, I've been diving into the world of psychology; it's fascinating to learn about human behavior and the mind. How about you? What aspect of technology are you most excited about?
    Charlie: I'm really into artificial intelligence and machine learning, Alice. It's amazing how these technologies can solve complex problems and even mimic human-like thinking. I also enjoy tinkering with robotics on the side. Have you ever thought about how psychology could intersect with AI?
